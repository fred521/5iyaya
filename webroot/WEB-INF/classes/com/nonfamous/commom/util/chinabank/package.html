We can download the utility class from web site www.chinabank.com.cn

the classes included in packages:
	beartool.MD5
	com.chinabank.c2c.security.B64Code
	com.chinabank.c2c.security.Crypt
	com.chinabank.c2c.security.CryptUtil
	com.chinabank.c2c.security.ExtMDigester

Since we don't need extend it for now, so just place it on hold and use
the upper classes directly.

In future, if we do need extend the utility, we can put into here.
